This is a story about a fox and a crow.
A piece of cheese was held by the crow.
The fox wanted the cheese and spoke to the crow.
"Your voice is very beautiful," said the fox.
The crow, flattered by the compliment, cawed loudly.
As the crow opened its mouth, the cheese fell and was grabbed by the fox.
