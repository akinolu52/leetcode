This is a story about a Fox and a crow.
A piece of cheese was held tightly by the crow.
The Fox wanted cheese and spoke gently to the crow.
"Your voice is beautiful," remarked the fox.
The crow, feeling flattered by the compliment, cawed very loudly.
As the crow opened its beak, the cheese fell down and was quickly grabbed by the fox.
The moral of the story is not to be deceived by flattery.
